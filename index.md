The Design for Wellbeing design module was focused around designing applications that respond to user emotions to promote wellbeing. My team decided to focus on eliciting the emotion of laughter and providing a user with a tool they can use to cheer themselves up with.

### [Design for Tension](https://medium.com/@sambaumgarten/design-for-tension-4b97ecd66969)

The Design for Tension module was designed to provide an opportunity to explore how humans interact with chatbots and how we can use our understanding of human emotions and reactions to convey information about sensitive topics.

### [Design For Understanding](https://medium.com/@sambaumgarten/design-for-understanding-63e0874c83a1)

The Design for Understanding module was focused around finding ways to intuitively present information in ways that both convey lots of information as well as in ways that make a message obvious.

### [Design for Others](https://medium.com/@jpking_52113/design-for-others-b027c6e6d53e)

The Design for Others module tasked us to re-design an established website for mobile users of a specific demographic. In my groups case, we redesigned the Worcester Public Library website for users that were aged 75â€“85, with average computer/browser literacy.
