# Design Manifesto

## About Me

My name is Sam. I am a senior at WPI and will be joining Apple in May as a softeware engineer. I have been working as an engineer for the past 8 years consulting at companies such as IDEO, Adobe, and dozens of other startups.

## Design Philosophy

In this document, I will be using the design modules and readings from CS3041 to establish what I concider to be the core tenants of my design philosophy. These five tenents what I concider to be the most important conciderations to evaluate in any design project. The five tenents are as follows:
* Consider the audience
* Less can be more
* Consider the user's reaction
* Technology shouldn't detract from design
* Use data to refine design

### Consider the audience

To design without knowing the audience of an application is simpley an exercise in asthetics. To build useful applications requires an intimate understand of how you expect users to use your product. If you designed a [Bloomberg Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Terminal) with an audience of kids aged 3-5 in mind, the actual customers would find the system extremely hard to use and limiting.
This was one of my team's primary conciderations in all the design modules but it was especially relevent in [Design for Others](https://medium.com/@jpking_52113/design-for-others-b027c6e6d53e).

### Less can be more

Through this class, many design modules ended up being fairly simple due to the time constraints imposed. The teams I was on generally descided to limit the scope of our projects so we could really focus on one aspect. By eliminating everything except for the core use cases, our designs tended to be very intuative. [Design for Others](https://medium.com/@jpking_52113/design-for-others-b027c6e6d53e) and [Design for Tension](https://medium.com/@sambaumgarten/design-for-tension-4b97ecd66969) were key examples of this. In Design for Others, my team stripped away everything but the key information from the Worcester Public Library site. We were redesigning it for users 75-85 so by just providing key actions at the top of the page, users could more easily find common information. This came at the expense of being less powerful. Design for Tension was an example where we didn't simplify by removing information but rather by tailoring the design to the individual user. In this project, my team built a chatbot to convince users to vaccinate their children. We had the bot start by asking the user various questions to best know what information to present to them. While from a development perspective, this isn't less, the user only sees relevent information to them making the experience simpler and more intuitive.
