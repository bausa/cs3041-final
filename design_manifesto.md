## Design Philosophy

In this document, I will be using the design modules and readings from CS 3041 to establish what I concider to be the core tenants of my design philosophy. These five tenents what I concider to be the most important conciderations to evaluate in any design project. The five tenents are as follows:
* Consider the audience
* Less can be more
* Consider the user's reaction
* Technology shouldn't detract from design
* Use data to refine design

### Consider the audience

To design without knowing the audience of an application is simpley an exercise in asthetics. To build useful applications requires an intimate understand of how you expect users to use your product. If you designed a [Bloomberg Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Terminal) with an audience of kids aged 3-5 in mind, the actual customers would find the system extremely hard to use and limiting.
This was one of my team's primary conciderations in all the design modules but it was especially relevent in [Design for Others](https://medium.com/@jpking_52113/design-for-others-b027c6e6d53e). In this module my team redesigned a website for elderly people. We designed elements to be large to meet accessibility standards and make the page easier to read for people without great eyesight. We also made changes like removing expanding elements from the homepage to make the location of elements as clear as possible. These may not have been good descision if we were targeting a young audience; however, our knowledge of our audience made these much clearer descisions to make.

### Less can be more

Through this class, many design modules ended up being fairly simple due to the time constraints imposed. The teams I was on generally descided to limit the scope of our projects so we could really focus on one aspect. By eliminating everything except for the core use cases, our designs tended to be very intuative. [Design for Others](https://medium.com/@jpking_52113/design-for-others-b027c6e6d53e) and [Design for Tension](https://medium.com/@sambaumgarten/design-for-tension-4b97ecd66969) were key examples of this. In Design for Others, my team stripped away everything but the key information from the Worcester Public Library site. We were redesigning it for users 75-85 so by just providing key actions at the top of the page, users could more easily find common information. This came at the expense of being less powerful. Design for Tension was an example where we didn't simplify by removing information but rather by tailoring the design to the individual user. In this project, my team built a chatbot to convince users to vaccinate their children. We had the bot start by asking the user various questions to best know what information to present to them. While from a development perspective, this isn't less, the user only sees relevent information to them making the experience simpler and more intuitive.

### Consider the user's reaction

A negative user reaction can be devistating to any design project or the functionality of any application. An example of this was mentioned in class when discussing the impact on non-asthetically pleasing designs. The presentation showed that users perception on the intuitiveness of design is closely related with their view of the asthetic qualities. Another example of where this principal comes up is in the [Design for Wellbeing Module](https://medium.com/@sambaumgarten/design-for-wellbeing-f4c02c109f0e). In this module, my team built an application that used the Affectiva JS library to react to users' expressed emotions. We presented various memes and kept track of which ones the user enjoyed. In our user testing, we found that users liked the application significantly more if they enjoyed the genre of memes we presented. By making this application adapt to a user's individual tastes, we could've improved the user experience. Another way this principal can be concidered with regards to the Design for Wellbeing Module is to look at how an actual user would feel about the use of the Affectiva library. My team hypothisized that in the real world, users would be very concerned with their webcam being used to monitor their emotions and would make them less comfortable using the application.

### Technology shouldn't detract from design

Technology for its own sake gets tiring very quickly. Designs should not incorperate new things that don't feel right or are gimicky. This pricipal was exemplified in [Design for Tension](https://medium.com/@sambaumgarten/design-for-tension-4b97ecd66969) and [Design for Wellbeing](https://medium.com/@sambaumgarten/design-for-wellbeing-f4c02c109f0e). In Design for Wellbeing, we made use of the Affectiva library. This library was cool to play with but required that users make very exagerated emotions for it to pick them up. This made it feel gimicky and would be distracting on a real website. In the Design for Tension module we built a chatbot. It was the consensous of the class that most people thought chatbots were slower than using a standard website to find information yourself. While it was interesting to design a chatbot personality and flow, I wouldn't have used the result had it been a real website. In both of these projects we picked the topic based on the technology. If we were tasked with the topic, I wouldn't have chose the technologies specified.
