# Design Manifesto

In this document, I will be using the design modules and readings from CS3041 to establish what I concider to be the core tenants of my design philosophy. These five tenents what I concider to be the most important conciderations to evaluate in any design project. The five tenents are as follows:
* Consider the audience
* Less can be more
* Consider the user's reaction
* Technology shouldn't detract from design
* Use data to refine design

## Consider the audience

To design without knowing the audience of an application is simpley an exercise in asthetics. To build useful applications requires an intimate understand of how you expect users to use your product. If you designed a [Bloomberg Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Terminal) with an audience of kids aged 3-5 in mind, the actual customers would find the system extremely hard to use and limiting.
This was one of my primary conciderations in all the design modules but it was especially relevent in [Design for Wellbeing](https://medium.com/@sambaumgarten/design-for-wellbeing-f4c02c109f0e)
